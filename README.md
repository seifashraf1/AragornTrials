# Aragorn Trials
The Quest to Find Middle-earth’s True Champion using Reinforcement Learning

In the twilight of the Third Age, as shadows deepen over Middle-earth, a dire threat looms over all free peoples. Sauron, the Dark Lord of Mordor, has regained much of his former strength, and his malice spreads across the lands like a rising tide. In these dark times, hope rests on a knife’s edge, and the fate of the world depends on the courage and strength of its
heroes. Among these heroes stands Aragorn, son of Arathorn, the rightful heir to the throne of Gondor. As a leader of the Free Peoples, Aragorn understands the gravity of the coming war. He knows that to stand against Sauron, Middle-earth must place its trust in the mightiest
of champions, a hero capable of overcoming the most perilous quests and leading the forces of good to victory. But the paths of Middle-earth are fraught with danger, and the true strength of each hero is veiled in mystery. From the noble halls of Rivendell to the rugged wilds of Rohan, heroes of all races have answered the call—Men, Elves, Dwarves, and even Hobbits. Yet who among them is worthy to be named the Champion of Middle-earth? Aragorn must decide, for the time of reckoning draws near.

Aragorn’s goal is to identify the hero with the highest probability of successfully com-
pleting the most dangerous and crucial quests. However, the true potential of each hero is unknown at the outset. Through trials and quests, Aragorn must gather knowledge of their
abilities, learning from their successes and failures, to ultimately choose the one hero who
will lead the charge against Sauron’s dark forces. As a trusted advisor to Aragorn, you have been entrusted with the sacred duty of devising
a strategy to discover the greatest hero of Middle-earth. Through a series of trials, you will
guide Aragorn in deciding which hero to send on quests, using both exploration to uncover
hidden strengths and exploitation to maximize the power of known talents.
